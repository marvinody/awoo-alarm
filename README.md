# Twitter sucks

I mean really.

## It sucks.

This was supposed to be a really quick project but I had to go through so many loops starting with trying to get a new account.

- Decide to make the account
- Use my domain email with a doubly-nested domain that redirects all email so I know who's selling my data
- Tells me I'm a bot so gives me a recaptcha
- Pass and it tells me I'm a bot again so it gives me another
- OK..., I'll do that one too
- "We also need a phone number"
- Uh no, you're not getting my main number for this account, I'll use a burner
  - Walk to CVS and buy burner phone
  - Buy card from Walmart online but never get email and the purchase gets cancelled
  - Hop on a chat with customer service rep and have them approve my purchase and fix email
  - Wait for another hour for the email to arrive but nothing...thanks...
  - Screw it, I'll get it from BestBuy
    - Buy wrong card and it doesn't give me service
    - Try to buy the right card but the second purchase never gets confirmed
- Screw it, I'll start looking at docs and stuff and write out the general logic while I wait
- Finish most of the general outline including making it somewhat modular for other simple time uses
- Alright, still no email, let me grab dev credentials for one of the extra accounts I have
- "We require new developer applications moving forward"
- Check application time for some other people
- Bots are apparently super restricted now

Twitter...bruh, you're already the Internet's cesspool and you're trying to stop devs? I think your problem is elsewhere.

Lost all the will to keep going with this for now but I'm still putting this up because, honestly, I'm angry.

It's almost 5am right now and Twitter put these restrictions in place because they can't police their network so they shut new people out and don't clean out the mess.

But that's OK, it's probably better for me to get away from a flaming turd :)
